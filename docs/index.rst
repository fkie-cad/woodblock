Welcome to Woodblock's documentation!
=====================================


The goal of Woodblock is to make it as easy as possible to generate file
carving test data sets such as the ones created by the `DFRWS`_ in their
`2006`_ and `2007`_ challenges or by the ones created by `NIST`_.

Have a look at the :ref:`overview` to learn about the concepts and to find out
what you can do with Woodblock.
